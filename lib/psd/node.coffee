# The Node abstraction is one of the most important in PSD.js. It's the base for the
# tree representation of the document structure. Every layer and group is a node in
# the document tree. All common functionality is here, and both layers and groups extend
# this class with specialized functionality.
#
# While you can access the layer data directly, the Node interface provides a somewhat
# higher-level API that makes it easier and less verbose to access the wealth of
# information that's stored in each PSD.
